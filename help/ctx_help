A context configuration file contains a list of executable programs and
their parameters that will be simulated by Multi2Sim. The context
configuration file is a plain text file in the IniFile format, containing
as many sections as x86 programs simulated. Each program is denoted with
a section called '[ Context <num> ]', where <num> is an integer number
starting from 0.

Variables in section '[ Context <num> ]':

  Exe = <path> (Required)
      Path for the x86 executable file that will be simulated.
  Args = <arg_list>
      List of command-line arguments for the simulated program.
  Env = <env_list>
      List of environment variables enumerated using single or double
      quotes. These variables will be added to the current set of
      active environment variables.
      E.g.: Env = 'ENV_VAR1=100' \ENV_VAR2=200\
  Cwd = <path>
      Current working directory for simulated program. If not specified,
      the current working directory for the simulator will be also used
      for the simulated program.
  StdIn = <file>
      File to use as standard input for the simulated program. If none
      specified, the simulator standard input is selected.
  StdOut = <file>
      File to use as standard output and standard error output for the
      simulated program. If none specified, the standard output for the
      simulator is used in both cases.
  IPCReport = <file>
      File to dump a report of the context performance. At specific
      intervals, the context IPC (instructions-per-cycle) value will be
      dumped in this file. This option must be specified together with
      command-line option '--x86-sim detailed'.
  IPCReportInterval = <cycles>
      Interval in number of cycles that a new record will be added into
      the IPC report file.

See the Multi2Sim Guide (www.multi2sim.org) for further details and
examples on how to use the context configuration file.
